<li>Bitcoin is a very popular virtual currency. 
<li>Bitcoin's value has risen a lot since its inception and will probably only continue to rise.
<li>As of right now, Bitcoin's price has fallen recently to around $49,000.
<li>Even though the price has fallen it is very likely that it will rise back up to the $60,000 it was a week ago.
<li>The price of Bitcoin is predicted to rise to $75,000 by the end of the year. 
<li>With Bitcoin's popularity some people see Bitcoin as the currency of the future. 
<li>In September the country of El Savador made Bitcoin a currency. 
<li>This decision brought along a lot of controversy. 
<li>Many people beleive the decision was rushed.
<li>The bill for Bitcoin to become a currency was proposed on June 5th and then passed on June 8th.
<li>Many citizens disagreed with this decision and have rioted as a result.
<li>There are a lot of risks that come with this decision since no other country as ever done something like this before.
<li>This is a huge step for Bitcoin as it could lead to other countries to do the same.
<li>On the other hand, China has done the oppsite of El Salvador. 
<li>They have completely banned Bitcoin and have driven Bitcoin miners out of the country.
<li>This isn't too much of a surprise as since Bitcoin is independent, governments can't tax it and therefore get no money from transactions.
<li>Since China likes to be in complete control so they could try to make their own cryptocurrency that they can put a tax on just like regular money.
<li>Making Bitcoin a currency is a cool idea but with all the possible risks it has it may not be worth it.
