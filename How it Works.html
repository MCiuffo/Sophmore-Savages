<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is a cryptocurrency that stricly runs and relies on a blockchain. A<strong>Blockchain</strong> is a database that is shared in a computer network. It stores information from things, in this case, Bitcoin, electronically making it digitally. The blockchain is a good thing to use for Bitcoin because it secures safety with user's information.      </p>
<ul>
<li>A person who wants to start using Bitcoin has to do a few tasks to use it. The first thing that they should do is download the Bitcoin Wallet app. They should download this app to their personal device. Doing this step supports your Bitcoin account. </li>
<li>Blockchains help Bitcoin Wallets calculate a person's personal balance that they are able to send and recieve Bitcoin to/from someone else. The fact that it is on a blockchain, helps verify that the person sent or recieved the Bitcoin. </li>
<li>The Bitcoin Wallet keeps a piece of data. This piece of data is called "private key." This piece of data is used specifically for mathematical proof. The proof is needed to once again, verify that it is the actual owner sending from the Bitcoin wallet. </li>
<p><strong>Mining</strong> is also another system that helps confirm the transactions of Bitcoin. </p>
