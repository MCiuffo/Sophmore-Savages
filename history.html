<p style="font-size:135%;"> Bitcoin was first introduced in 2008 by a pysuedomenous person named Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knew who this person really was or if it was really just one person. Nakamoto made a post into a cryptography mailing list that was named "Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper." There was another one named "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."(The History of Bitcoin, n.d.) These two papers were a concept of how Bitcoin was going to be laid out. These described how there would be no middle man when having bitcoin. It would be a decentralized digital currency.(The History of Bitcoin, n.d) The coins would be used on a peer-to-peer network. This means that coins would go from user to user. Bitcoin was first launched in 2009. The first economic transaction was in 2010. A man ordered two Papa John's pizzas using Bitcoin.</p>
<p style="font-size:135%;"> Over the years, bitcoins price has gone up. In 2011, it was $1-$31. In 2013, it was $200. In 2017, the price went up drastically to $19,650. Today the price has been fluctuating. It has been around $60,000.</p>
