<p style="font-size:135%;"> Bitcoin is a decentricalized digital currency. This digital currency makes international payments easy and cheap because it is not tied to a specific place. This could benefit small businesses becuase they would not have credit card fees. This can be invested in as well. Many people invest in this currency today because it is constantly growing in price. More companies are trying to adopt bitcoin because of the benefits that it has. As technology progresses cryptocurrencies will become a big part of the world. This could possibly take over paper currency. The country of El Salvador has already made bitcoin as their national currency. This has many benefits as well as many negatives. As cryptocurrencies advance people need to take advantage of the positive uses of it.</p>
